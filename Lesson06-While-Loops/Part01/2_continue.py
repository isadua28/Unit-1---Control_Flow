## The Continue Statement
'''
**continue** = Skip to the next iteration! 

**Difference from break:**
- **break** -> Exit the loop completely
- **continue** -> Skip current iteration, keep looping

# Example skip 3
count = 0
while count < 5: 
    count += 1
    if count == 3: 
        continue
    print(count) # 1 2   4 5
